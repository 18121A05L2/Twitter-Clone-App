   What Is ERC-20?
-> ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible tokens created using the Ethereum blockchain. A fungible token is one that is exchangeable 
   with another token, whereas the well-known ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are not.
-> The ERC-20 standard has a vital role within the blockchain; it defines a standard list of rules that Ethereum tokens using smart contracts 
   must adhere to. Some of these rules include how the tokens can be transferred, how transactions are approved, how users can access data 
   about a token, and the total supply of tokens

   What is a Non-Fungible Token?
-> A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is used to identify something or someone in a unique way. This type of Token is perfect to be used on platforms 
   that offer collectible items, access keys, lottery tickets, numbered seats for concerts and sports matches, etc. This special type of Token 
   has amazing possibilities so it deserves a proper Standard, the ERC-721 came to solve that!

   What is ERC-721?
-> The ERC-721 introduces a standard for NFT, in other words, this type of Token is unique and can have different value than another Token 
   from the same Smart Contract, maybe due to its age, rarity or even something else like its visual. Wait, visual?
