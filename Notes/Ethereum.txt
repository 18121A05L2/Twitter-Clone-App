-> multisig wallets , counterfactual accounts , gnoysis safe , tornado cash ( exclusion list in proof of innocence )
-> privacy for the weak and transperancy for the powerful
-> Peer scoring algorithms
-> Pos is not just a block driven but also a time driven network
-> Beacon nodes ( consensus ) database was 50-Gb and the execution client has between 500-700 GB
-> We need to run separate consensus and execution clients, which has their own p2p nodes and data will come through consensus to execution through Engine API
-> Putting ur wallet ( private key ) inside the execution client for those key management APIs was dumb
-> What are archive nodes
-> 1Ether = 10^18 wei , 1Ether = 10^9 Gwei
-> The state root hash is the hash of the root node of the state trie after the execution of all the transactions included in the block.
-> When a light client needs to verify a specific part of the state (e.g., the balance of an account or the result of a transaction), it can request a Merkle proof from a full node
-> A Merkle proof is a path in the Merkle Patricia Trie from a particular leaf (the account or storage data) up to the state root hash
-> Ethereum 2.0 divides time into periods called epochs (each epoch consists of 32 slots, with each slot lasting 12 seconds) -- Assume there are 100,000 active validators. For a block to be justified, at least 66,667 validators (â…”) need to attest to it in an epoch
-> A bug in a consensus client with over 33% of the Ethereum nodes could prevent the consensus layer from finalizing
-> Epochs are units of 32 slots - each slot lasts 12 seconds - Slots and epochs set the pace of the blockchain --> In each epoch, the block in the first slot is a checkpoint. These checkpoints are important because they are used to make sections of the blockchain permanent and irreversible ( justified Epochs and Finalized Epochs )
-> a validator will participate in a sync committee. A sync committee is a group of 512 randomly chosen validators that sign block headers so that light clients can retrieve validated blocks without having to access the full historical chain or the full validator set
