-> multisig wallets , counterfactual accounts , gnoysis safe , tornado cash ( exclusion list in proof of innocence )
-> privacy for the weak and transperancy for the powerful
-> Peer scoring algorithms
-> Pos is not just a block driven but also a time driven network
-> Beacon nodes ( consensus ) database was 50-Gb and the execution client has between 500-700 GB
-> We need to run separate consensus and execution clients, which has their own p2p nodes and data will come through consensus to execution through Engine API
-> Putting ur wallet ( private key ) inside the execution client for those key management APIs was dumb
-> What are archive nodes
-> 1Ether = 10^18 wei , 1Ether = 10^9 Gwei
-> The state root hash is the hash of the root node of the state trie after the execution of all the transactions included in the block.
-> When a light client needs to verify a specific part of the state (e.g., the balance of an account or the result of a transaction), it can request a Merkle proof from a full node
-> A Merkle proof is a path in the Merkle Patricia Trie from a particular leaf (the account or storage data) up to the state root hash
-> Ethereum 2.0 divides time into periods called epochs (each epoch consists of 32 slots, with each slot lasting 12 seconds) -- Assume there are 100,000 active validators. For a block to be justified, at least 66,667 validators (â…”) need to attest to it in an epoch
-> A bug in a consensus client with over 33% of the Ethereum nodes could prevent the consensus layer from finalizing
-> Epochs are units of 32 slots - each slot lasts 12 seconds - Slots and epochs set the pace of the blockchain --> In each epoch, the block in the first slot is a checkpoint. These checkpoints are important because they are used to make sections of the blockchain permanent and irreversible ( justified Epochs and Finalized Epochs )
-> a validator will participate in a sync committee. A sync committee is a group of 512 randomly chosen validators that sign block headers so that light clients can retrieve validated blocks without having to access the full historical chain or the full validator set
-> the validator is slashed. This means that 1/64th of their staked ether (up to a maximum of 0.5 ether) is immediately burned, then a 36 day removal period begins
-> Execution Client is not responsible for block building, block gossiping or handling consensus logic
-> Execution Client - home to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Ethereum's state and transaction pool
-> The consensus client does not participate in attesting to or proposing blocks - this is done by a validator, an optional add-on to a consensus client
-> Node operators can add a validator to their consensus clients by depositing 32 ETH in the deposit contract. The validator client comes bundled with the consensus client and can be added to a node at any time
-> Randomly selecting a subset of 512 validators every 1.1 days to act as a sync committee - The sync committee signs the header of recent blocks which is helpful for Light clients - This means a light client can quickly see that the sync committee has signed off on the data they receive, and they can also check that the sync committee is the genuine one by comparing the one they receive from the one they were told to expect in the previous block -- checked against block headers that they know have been signed by at least 2/3 of a random set of 512 Ethereum validators
-> Currently, light clients rely on RPC requests to full nodes using a client/server model, but in the future the data could be requested in a more decentralized way using a dedicated network such as the Portal Network(opens in a new tab) that could serve the data to light clients using a peer-to-peer gossip protocol
-> Ethereum Networking Protocols - Both stacks work in parallel. The discovery stack feeds new network participants into the network, and the DevP2P stack enables their interactions
-> A successful PING-PONG "bonds" the new node to a bootnode
-> start client --> connect to bootnode --> bond to bootnode --> find neighbours --> bond to neighbours
-> storage optimisations and categorises them into replication-based, redaction-based, and content-based optimisations. Replication-based optimisations focus on reducing duplication of blockchain data shared among participants after committing data on the blockchain ledger. Redaction-based optimisations allow users to modify or delete data already committed on the ledger in various ways, while content-based optimisations compress data before or after committing it to the ledger

-> . In a function call, what is the difference between 'call' and 'staticcall'?
-> On Ethereum there are a few different types of transactions:
    -> Regular transactions: a transaction from one account to another.
    -> Contract deployment transactions: a transaction without a 'to' address, where the data field is used for the contract code.
    -> Execution of a contract: a transaction that interacts with a deployed smart contract. In this case, 'to' address is the smart contract address.
