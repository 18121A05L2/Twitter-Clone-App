-> byteCode - huffc <FilenName> -b
-> function dispatching - extracting the function selector from the calldata provided to the contract and dispatching our function call to the respective funtion 
-> bytecode contains - contract creation byte code , runtime bytecode and metadata seperated with INVALID opcode ; may be only runtime code stays on onchain
-> PUSH1 optcode will push hex values into the stack , ADD optocde will pull those and add those and push the result back to the stack
-> cast --to-base 0xF0102 bin -- will give 0b11110000000100000010
-> hex , bin , dec 
-> CALLDATALOAD - loads 32 bytes from the calldata by removing the number of bytes we provided as stack input ( EX : if we give zero it wold store from the 0th byte of the calldata , and for 1 it would store from 1st byte of the calldata (removing first byte) )
-> run time byteCode - huffc <FileLocaltion> --bin-runtime
-> JUMPDEST is a marker for valid jump locations in EVM bytecode, ensuring safe and predictable control flow for smart contracts. Without it, arbitrary jumps could break contract logic or create security vulnerabilities
