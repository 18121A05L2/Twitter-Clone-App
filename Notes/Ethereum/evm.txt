--> What Does "Offset in Memory" Mean?
An offset in memory refers to a specific position or "address" (in bytes) in the memory where some data begins. For example:

If you store a uint256 (32 bytes) at memory location 0, then its offset is 0.
If you store another uint256 immediately after that, its offset is 32.

--> What is a "byte offset"?
A byte offset refers to the specific position (in bytes) of a piece of data within the calldata.
Think of calldata as a continuous sequence of bytes. Each piece of information (function selector, arguments, etc.) is stored at a specific byte position. The offset tells you how far into the calldata a certain piece of data is located.
