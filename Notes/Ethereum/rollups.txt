--> Roll ups 
  - executes the transactions, compress the data and rolls it up to the Main chain in a single batch  
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU 
    1) optimistic rollups ( they use dispute resolution system for  fraud proofs ) - Ex: arbitrum and optimism
      - half of the penalized money will be burned and other half will be given to who have challenged and found the frad blocks
    2) zero knowledge rollups ( validity proofs ) - Ex: zksync and polygon zk evm , loopring
    3) how does the state be consistant when we are running transactions in off chain and what if the user tries to do the transaction
       at two places the at same time ?
    4) what is zkporter
    5) EIP-4844 introduces new kind of transaction which accepts blobs of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short amount of time
       -> BLOB is represented as Binary Large Objects
       -> blobs are 4096 fields elements of 32 bytes each
       -> what is proto danksharding ? - scalable data , availability data
       -> initially , Dencun is targeting 6 blobs per block 4096*32*6 = 0.75Mb per block
       -> blobs are short lived and pruned after around 2 weeks
       -> unlike calldata blobs are not available in EVM
       -> blobs are persistant on the beacon nodes ( consensus layer ) but not on the execution layer
       -> if we have a smart contract function that is deployed to onchain , if we want to try to access the blob data , we cannot access it directly 
         , but we can access the a hash of the data with the new BLOBHASH code
       -> whar are kzg commitments ? - hash of the blob data
       -> blocks contains Regular transactions and Data transactions ( does everything a regular transaction does ) , Data transaction may contains the hash of the blobs too as an extra than Regular
       -> blobs are breaked into tiny pieces to stored as distrubuted with the help of the bittorrent

--> possible scalability solutions  - sharding , roll ups , proto Danksharding , lightening network , Plasma and state channels
