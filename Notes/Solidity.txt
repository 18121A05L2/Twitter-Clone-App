—> stack is the local variable ( cheapest of all variables )
—> calldata was the temp variable that can't be modified, memory was the temp variable that can be modified in the function execution 
-> Data location can only be specified for arrays ,structs or mappings ( a string is an array or bytes )
—> we can't add state variable in libraries
—> new address[](size) - dynamic arrays in Solidity are initialised with default values ( here zero addresses )
—> Solidity is a synchronous language
—> for an external call always has calldata ( which stores parameters )
—> internal functions can only have references , it wont need callldata or memory
—> function modifiers can be inefficient ( repetitive code copy )
