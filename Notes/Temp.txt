On Ethereum there are a few different types of transactions:

-> Regular transactions: a transaction from one account to another.
-> Contract deployment transactions: a transaction without a 'to' address, where the data field is used for the contract code.
-> Execution of a contract: a transaction that interacts with a deployed smart contract. In this case, 'to' address is the smart contract address.
