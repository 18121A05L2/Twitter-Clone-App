--> Roll ups 
  - executes the transactions, compress the data and rolls it up to the Main chain in a single batch  
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU 
    1) optimistic rollups ( they use dispute resolution system for  fraud proofs ) - Ex: arbitrum and optimism
    2) zero knowledge rollups ( validity proofs ) - Ex: zksync and polygon zk evm , loopring
    3) how does the state be consistant when we are running transactions in off chain and what if the user tries to do the transaction
       at two places the at same time ?
    4) what is zkporter
    5) EIP-4844 introduces new kind of transaction which accepts blobs of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short amount of time
       -> blobs are 4096 fields elements of 32 bytes each
       -> initially , Dencun is targeting 6 blobs per block 4096*32*6 = 0.75Mb per block
       -> blobs are short lived and pruned after 2 weeks
       -> unlike call data blobs are not available in EVM
       -> blobs are persistant on the beacon nodes ( consensus layer ) but not on the execution layer
       -> if we have a smart contract function that is deployed to onchaing , if we want to try to access the blob data , we cannot access it directly
       -> whar are kzg commitments ? - hash of the blob data
—> difference between full nodes and half nodes and master nodes
      - lightweight nodes have low storage requirements because they just need to download block headers to verify transactions
         and they are dependent on full nodes
—> what is ethereum world state ( World State Trie ) 
—> chain link , moralis , ethers , graph 
—> What and how does Layer 2 works ?
—> How does private and public keys are being generated ( Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm ) ?
—> 1 Eth = 1*10**9 Gwei      , 1 Eth = 1*10**18 Wei
—> Eip 1559 fee model ( the base fee can increase or decrease 12.5 % per block based on the greater than 50 % or
   less than 50% block utilization , base gas fee is 50 Gwei
—> max inflation for the Eth is 0.5 - 2 % per year
—> current Layer 1 Ethereum processes 15 transactions per second
—> what does handling transactions in off chain means with layer 2 technology  ( state channels and payment channels  ) 
—>  plasma framework for layer2 - child chains ( omg network ) ?
—> side chains - xthai ( side chains derive their security based on their own protocols , but Roll ups derive their security from the base layers ) 
—> what is sharding , proto-danksharding and danksharding
—> consensus types 1) chain selecrion and 2 ) sybil resistance ( POW )
—> sharding and roll ups are solutions for the scalability issues 
—> bridging mechanisms 1) locking and unlocking 2) burning and minting
