—> difference between full nodes and half nodes and master nodes
      - lightweight nodes have low storage requirements because they just need to download block headers to verify transactions
         and they are dependent on full nodes
—> what is ethereum world state ( World State Trie ) 
—> chain link , moralis , ethers , graph 
—> What and how does Layer 2 works ?
—> How does private and public keys are being generated ( Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm ) ?
—> 1 Eth = 1*10**9 Gwei      , 1 Eth = 1*10**18 Wei
—> Eip 1559 fee model ( the base fee can increase or decrease 12.5 % per block based on the greater than 50 % or
   less than 50% block utilization , base gas fee is 50 Gwei
—> max inflation for the Eth is 0.5 - 2 % per year
—> current Layer 1 Ethereum processes 15 transactions per second
—> what does handling transactions in off chain means with layer 2 technology  ( state channels and payment channels  ) 
—>  plasma framework for layer2 - child chains ( omg network ) ?
—> side chains - xthai ( side chains derive their security based on their own protocols , but Roll ups derive their security from the base layers ) 
—> what is sharding , proto-danksharding and danksharding
—> consensus types 1) chain selection and 2 ) sybil resistance ( POW )
—> sharding and roll ups are solutions for the scalability issues 
—> bridging mechanisms 1) locking and unlocking 2) burning and minting
